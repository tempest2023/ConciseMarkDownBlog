### Projects

Showcase your projects here. Use badges, images, and links to make them stand out.

## Example Project

- [My Awesome Project](https://github.com/yourusername/project)
  ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-52BAD7?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=white)
  A brief description of what this project does and why it's interesting.

## How to Add Projects

Use this format for each project:

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://link-to-project)
  ![Tag](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Tag-Color?style=flat)
  A brief description of the project.
```

You can also embed GitHub repo cards:

```markdown
<a href="https://github.com/user/repo">
  <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=user&repo=repo" />
</a>
```
