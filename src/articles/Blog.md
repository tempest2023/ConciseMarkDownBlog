### How to Organize Blog Posts

1. Create a folder inside `src/articles/Blogs/` for each category (e.g., `JavaScript`, `Python`, `Career`)
2. Add your markdown files inside those folders
3. Link to them here using the format: `[Post Title](/?page=Blogs/Category/FileName)`

### Example Structure

src/articles/Blogs/
  GettingStarted/
    MyFirstPost.md
  JavaScript/
    AsyncAwait.md
    Closures.md
  Career/
    FirstJob.md
```
